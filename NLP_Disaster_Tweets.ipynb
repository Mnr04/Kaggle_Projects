    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, part of a Kaggle \"Getting Started\" competition, we will tackle a Natural Language Processing (NLP) challenge focused on analyzing tweets related to disasters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter has become a vital communication channel during times of crisis, allowing people to report real-time emergencies using their smartphones. As a result, disaster relief organizations and news agencies are increasingly interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter for relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, determining whether a tweet is truly about a disaster can be challenging for machines. For example, a tweet might use the word **\"ABLAZE\"** metaphorically, making it difficult for a model to identify the context without additional cues. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Kaggle competition is to build a machine learning model that can predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided for this competition consists of **10,000 manually classified tweets**, offering a solid foundation for training classification models. This is a great opportunity for those new to NLP, and a quick tutorial is available to help you get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the dataset, build our model, and evaluate its performance throughout this notebook. Letâ€™s dive in!"
